## üöÄ Implementation Examples

### Infrastructure Examples
1. **Terraform Testing**
   ```hcl
   resource "test_assertions" "example" {
     component = "vpc"

     equal "cidr_block" {
       description = "VPC CIDR block matches expected value"
       got         = aws_vpc.main.cidr_block
       want        = "10.0.0.0/16"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Container Testing**
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: test-pod
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: test-container
       image: nginx:latest
       securityContext:
         runAsNonRoot: true
   ```

### Security Examples
1. **Policy Testing**
   ```rego
   package kubernetes.admission
   
   deny[msg] {
     input.request.kind.kind == "Pod"
     not input.request.object.spec.securityContext.runAsNonRoot
     msg := "Pods must not run as root"
   }
   ```

2. **Compliance Testing**
   ```ruby
   control 'aws-1' do
     impact 1.0
     title 'Ensure S3 bucket has versioning enabled'
     
     describe aws_s3_bucket(bucket_name: 'my-bucket') do
       it { should have_versioning_enabled }
     end
   end
   ```
